      bind_address:
        description: |-
          Specify the address that the port will listen to. By
          default, only connections coming from localhost (127.0.0.1)
          will be forwarded.

          By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
          GatewayPorts setting. However, an explicit bind_address may
          be used to bind the connection to a specific address.

          The bind_address of 'localhost' indicates that the listening
          port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or
          '*' indicates that the port should be available from all
          interfaces.
