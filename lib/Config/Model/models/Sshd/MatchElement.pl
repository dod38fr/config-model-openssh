publickey,keyboard-interactive" would require the user to complete
public key authentication, followed by either password or keyboard
interactive authentication. Only methods that are next in one or more

restrict authentication to a specific device by appending a colon
followed by the device identifier "bsdauth", "pam", or "skey",

"keyboard-interactive:bsdauth" would restrict keyboard interactive
authentication to the "bsdauth" device.
